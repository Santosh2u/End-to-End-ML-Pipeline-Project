# End-to-End-ML-Pipeline---Temperature-Anomaly-Prediction-and-Analysis-Dashboard
My first ML project in GitHub. This ML project outlines the development of an end-to-end ML pipeline that aims to predict the temperature anomalies based on global weather data. 
This includes data cleaning, EDA, training and Model optimization and model deployments using Streamlit. 

1) Data Cleaning - Data pre-porocessing, feature engineering, cleaning data. 
2) Exploratory Data Analysis - Python and Tableau
3) Machine Learning Models:
   - Linear Regression Model
   - Random Forest
   - Decision Trees
4) Model Deployment - Streamlit
