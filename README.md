# End-to-End-ML-Pipeline---Temperature-Anomaly-Prediction-and-Analysis-Dashboard
My first ML project in GitHub. This ML project outlines the development of an end-to-end ML pipeline that aims to predict the temperature anomalies based on global weather data. 
This includes data cleaning, EDA, training and Model optimization and model deployments using Streamlit. 

-------------------

Required Files 

- All Python .py files and run files accordingly following the order - OESON, EDA, train and Deploy to follow ML pipeline. 
- Download all required libraries and packages in requirements.txt
- Inital dataset - Global_Temp.csv file
  
--------------------

Features on this project

1) Data Cleaning - Data pre-porocessing, feature engineering, cleaning data. 
2) Exploratory Data Analysis - Python and Tableau
3) Machine Learning Models:
   - Linear Regression Model
   - Random Forest
   - Decision Trees
4) Model Deployment - Streamlit

--------------------
Running Streamlit

After executing the Deploy.py file, in the terminal console type "streamlit run Deploy.py".
A link will show up or either a tab will open in your chosen default browser.
